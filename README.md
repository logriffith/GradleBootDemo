# GradleBootDemo

## Overview
This project that was assigned by LIDP Consulting Services, Inc as challenge to test my skill. The task was to build an app using Gradle. The app was to run on a Spring Boot server. The Angular front end was to be hosted on this server. After the app was built using Gradle, the jar file could be launched from the CLI. There were three required and three optional challenges in the original assignment. 
## Challenges
### Required
* It must be a Gradle project
* Implement Spring Boot into this project
    * The app should run on port 80
* Create a homepage using Angular and Angular Material
### Optional
* In the front end, prompt the user to enter their name. The page should change dynamically as the user inputs their name to display "Hello, John Smith"
* Create a RESTful web service that will get the name of the application and the current date. The front end should call the service when the page loads and display the information on the page
* Create a RESTful web service to calculate the circumference of a circle for a given radius, provided by the user. The user can input the radius in the front end, the radius would be sent to the back end, and the circumference would be sent back to the front end.
* Include in the front end using Angular Material:
    * A button that pops up a snackbar with some kind of message
    * A grid of 3 or more cards that display any type of content
    * A datepicker that allows the user to select their DOB and tells them their age
* Create a RESTful web service to get the system stats that include CPU usage, used and total RAM, used and total HDD space. This info would be returned and displayed to the user
* Connect the app to a relational database. The front end would include a form containing first name, last name, and favorite color fields. The user can create, get, update, and delete entries.
